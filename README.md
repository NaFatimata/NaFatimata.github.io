  In this project, I work with data collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan.

The center passes its blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. The dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of a random sample of 748 donors.

I predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window.

   In this project, I import employee and Human Resources data in CSV, Excel, and JSON formats. I then merge all the data into a single DataFrame before cleaning it and exporting the results into a single CSV file.

   SKILLS: Importing and Cleaning Data, Data Manipulation, Using DataFrames to read and merge data from different sources

   TECHNOLOGY: Python, Pandas

  In this project, I use survey data of approximately 20,000 people sampled from the United States to explore health behavior associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI).

Incorporating survey design methods, I use multiple regression to handle confounders when testinh whether physical activity is associated with lower BMI.

  SKILLS: Multiple and Logistic Regression in R, Analyzing survey data in R

  TECHNOLOGY: R, Tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2)

In this project, I use my SQL skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

I work with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, description, and website traffic.

I use techniques such as aggregation, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue.

In this project, I work with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

I look at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top 10 performing schools across the city.

TECHNOLOGY: SQL
