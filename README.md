  In this project, I use survey data of approximately 20,000 people sampled from the United States to explore health behavior associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI).

Incorporating survey design methods, I use multiple regression to handle confounders when testinh whether physical activity is associated with lower BMI.

  SKILLS: Multiple and Logistic Regression in R, Analyzing survey data in R

  TECHNOLOGY: R, Tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2)
